UltimakerOriginal
=================

In this repository you will find the documentation and source files for all parts in the Ultimaker-Original 3D printer. All parts are numbered. The BOM (bill of materials) directory should be your start point to find the files you need, as the BOM contains part numbers with amounts and names.
If you are missing a part or information feel free to file an issue on github.
